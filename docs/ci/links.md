Easy Coding Standard (ECS), 
PHPStan, 
Psalm.
More on those three later. In addition to them, there are also a lot of other tools. In my personal experience, I only used them sparingly, but some of them are definitely viable.  Youâ€™re welcome to give them a try.

PHP Code Style Fixer (PHP CS Fixer)
You can fix your code according to a chosen standard, including those developed by specific communities such as Symfony.

PHP Code Sniffer (PHP_CodeSniffer)
Corrects coding standard violations and tokenizes PHP, JS, and CSS files

Phan
A code analyzer with the goal of proving incorrectness, avoiding false-positives.

PHP Insights
Works with many frameworks, provides pretty reports.

Rector
It can help you upgrade your PHP.

SonarQube
This one has a large community and supports a lot of languages besides PHP.
